# Optimal Human-on-the-Loop Architectures for Autonomous Drone Swarms

**A Risk-Constrained Stochastic Framework for Multi-Zone Command and Control**

---

## Overview

This project provides a complete research paper and computational implementation for determining optimal operator-to-drone ratios in multi-zone autonomous drone operations under human-on-the-loop command-and-control constraints.

The framework answers a critical national security question: *How many autonomous platforms can a human operator structure responsibly oversee while maintaining meaningful human judgment over lethal engagement decisions?*
